## 📋 Project Overview

This is a **fully functional Android Budget Tracker** application developed as part of the OPSC6311 POE Part 2.


The app allows users to manage their personal finances by logging income and expenses, tracking spending by category over custom date ranges, setting monthly financial goals, and viewing all transactions with attached photos.

All data is persistently stored in a local **Room Database**. The app follows **MVVM architecture** with clean separation of concerns.

## Project Structure Highlights

- `data/` → Room entities, DAOs, Repositories
- `ui/` → All Compose screens and ViewModels
- `util/AppLogger.kt` → Central logging utility
- `MainActivity.kt` → Navigation and dependency setup

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Passwords are stored in plain text (for demonstration purposes only).
- `Bucket.kt` entity was created but not fully implemented (planned for Part 3 gamification/savings buckets).
- No unit tests included in this submission (will be added in final POE if required).
- Built and tested on Android 14 (API 34).

---

## 📌 Submission Information

- This is **Part 2** of the POE (App Prototype).
- All minimum requirements on pages 7–8 of the POE document have been fully implemented and exceeded.
- Ready for Part 3 (graphs, gamification, additional features).

**Thank you for reviewing our submission!**  
I am happy to answer any questions or demonstrate the app live.
